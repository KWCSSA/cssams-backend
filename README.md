##Things to implement sorted by priority (roughly)

* Restriction on number of postings everyday for a single account
* NUKE (暂时禁言或永久禁言） account for violating the wall's rules
* Smart feed stream - raising feed prioity for postings with more likes and comments
* Push Notifications
* Email verification
* Facebook login
* Image and avatar upload
* Personal messages (this can be quite interesting)
